# Programmer guidelines

- **Work only on your own branch.**  
  No one should commit directly to the **Development** branch.

- **Merging into Development:**  
  If you want to merge your WIP branch into **Development**, create a **pull request** and ping **Alex** on Discord.

- **Do not merge without a review!**
